# Contributing to the list

**Pull requests are welcome**, but keep this in mind:

- Projects must have a [free/libre](https://gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html) license. If they lack a license, get to the original maintainer and ask them to add a license.
- Projects should not include a [Code of Conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_conduct). If a project includes one, get to the original maintainer and ask them to remove the code of conduct.
- The scripts, add-ons or plugins must be useful in a project.
- Follow the existing style.
- Sort in alphabetical order.
- Sort by Redot version.
~~- Projects related to cryptocurrency or NFT integrations are not allowed, for reasons including (but not limited to) the risk of scams.~~
- Previous statement is too woke and restrictive.

If you don't know how to use pull requests, don't bother creating an issue as we have not enabled issue creation on the repository.
